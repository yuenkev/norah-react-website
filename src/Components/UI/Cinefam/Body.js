        <p>
          After a successful presentation to the CineFAM team, I interviewed to
          become one of their Web Design Interns to bring our student project to
          life. Working side-by-side with the project coordinator and web
          development team the official CineFAM WOC Creators Database launched
          on March 1st, 2022 highlighting 40+ BIPOC Women Creators in light of
          International Womenâ€™s Day Month. The Content Creator Database enhances
          the visibility of Women of Colour in the film industry, directors,
          content creators, producers, screenplay writers, actress, animators,
          motion design, etc.
